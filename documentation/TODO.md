## üìù Implementation Notes

### Strategy Implementation Order
Following SudokuWiki.org's difficulty classification:
1. Basic Strategies (Completed)
   - Singles (Naked/Hidden)
   - Pairs/Triples/Quads (Naked/Hidden)
   - Pointing Pairs
   - Box/Line Intersection

2. Tough Strategies (In Progress)
   - X-Wing
   - Swordfish
   - Wings (XY, XYZ, W)
   - Rectangle Patterns

3. Diabolical Strategies (Planned)
   - Chains and Cycles
