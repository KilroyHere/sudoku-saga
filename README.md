## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Solve a puzzle with default settings:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Solve a specific puzzle:
```bash
python main.py -p "530070000600195000098000060800060003400803001700020006060000280000419005000080079"
```

3. Enable verbose output:
```bash
python main.py -v
```

4. Provide a puzzle description:
```bash
python main.py -p "puzzle_string" -d "My difficult puzzle"
```

### GUI Visualization

1. Launch the GUI visualization with default puzzle:
```bash
python run_gui.py
```

2. Visualize a specific puzzle:
```bash
python run_gui.py -p "puzzle_string" -d "My puzzle"
```

3. Use a specific solver type:
```bash
python run_gui.py -s "Strategic" -p "puzzle_string"
```

#### GUI Controls
- **Previous/Next Buttons**: Navigate through solving steps
- **Auto Play Button**: Toggle automatic playback
- **Speed +/- Buttons**: Adjust auto-play speed
- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Navigate through steps
- **Space Bar**: Toggle auto-play mode

### Command-line Arguments

#### Main Solver
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output with detailed solving steps
- `-p, --puzzle`: Specify a Sudoku puzzle string (81 characters, use 0 or . for empty cells)
- `-d, --description`: Provide a description for the puzzle

#### GUI Visualization
- `-p, --puzzle`: Specify a Sudoku puzzle string
- `-d, --description`: Provide a description for the puzzle
- `-s, --solver`: Specify solver type ("Strategic" or "Backtracking")

### Output Modes

#### Non-verbose Mode
- Shows initial and final board states
- Displays strategies applied and their effects
- Provides a summary of strategies used

#### Verbose Mode
- Shows detailed step-by-step solving process
- Displays board state after each strategy application
- Shows candidate eliminations and value insertions
- Provides comprehensive solving statistics

#### GUI Mode
- Interactive visualization of the solving process
- Step-by-step navigation through solving strategies
- Visual highlighting of affected cells
- Display of candidates for each cell
- Auto-play feature with adjustable speed

### Advanced Usage

#### Testing Framework
```bash
python test/test_framework.py --test "puzzle_string" --verbose
```

#### Strategy Analysis
```bash
python test/test_framework.py --analyze 100 
```

## Solving Strategies

### Basic Strategies
1. **Single Candidate (Naked Singles)**
   - Finds cells with only one possible value

2. **Hidden Singles**
   - Identifies numbers that can only go in one cell in a unit

3. **Pointing Pairs/Triples**
   - When candidates in a box are restricted to one row/column

4. **Box/Line Intersection**
   - When candidates in a row/column are restricted to one box

5. **Naked/Hidden Pairs/Triples/Quads**
   - Groups of cells sharing the same candidates

### Advanced Strategies (In Development)
- X-Wing
- Swordfish
- Simple Coloring
- Y-Wing
- XYZ-Wing
- Rectangle Patterns

## Testing Framework

The project includes a comprehensive testing framework for:
- Strategy validation
- Performance analysis
- Puzzle difficulty assessment
- Solving process visualization

## GUI Visualization

The GUI visualization provides an educational tool for understanding how different Sudoku solving strategies work:

- **Interactive Controls**: Navigate through each step of the solving process
- **Board Visualization**: See the Sudoku board at each step
- **Candidate Visualization**: See the candidates for each cell at each step
- **Strategy Information**: See which strategy was applied at each step
- **Update Highlighting**: Cells affected by each strategy are highlighted
- **Auto-Play Mode**: Watch the solving process automatically with adjustable speed

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- pygame 2.5.2+

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
