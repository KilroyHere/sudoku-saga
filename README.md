## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Solve a puzzle with default settings:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Solve a specific puzzle:
```bash
python main.py -p "530070000600195000098000060800060003400803001700020006060000280000419005000080079"
```

3. Enable verbose output:
```bash
python main.py -v
```

4. Provide a puzzle description:
```bash
python main.py -p "puzzle_string" -d "My difficult puzzle"
```

### Command-line Arguments

- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output with detailed solving steps
- `-p, --puzzle`: Specify a Sudoku puzzle string (81 characters, use 0 or . for empty cells)
- `-d, --description`: Provide a description for the puzzle

### Output Modes

#### Non-verbose Mode
- Shows initial and final board states
- Displays strategies applied and their effects
- Provides a summary of strategies used

#### Verbose Mode
- Shows detailed step-by-step solving process
- Displays board state after each strategy application
- Shows candidate eliminations and value insertions
- Provides comprehensive solving statistics

### Advanced Usage

#### Testing Framework
```bash
python test/test_framework.py --test "puzzle_string" --verbose
```

#### Strategy Analysis
```bash
python test/test_framework.py --analyze 100 
```

## Solving Strategies

### Basic Strategies
1. **Single Candidate (Naked Singles)**
   - Finds cells with only one possible value

2. **Hidden Singles**
   - Identifies numbers that can only go in one cell in a unit

3. **Pointing Pairs/Triples**
   - When candidates in a box are restricted to one row/column

4. **Box/Line Intersection**
   - When candidates in a row/column are restricted to one box

5. **Naked/Hidden Pairs/Triples/Quads**
   - Groups of cells sharing the same candidates

### Advanced Strategies (In Development)
- X-Wing
- Swordfish
- Simple Coloring
- Y-Wing
- XYZ-Wing
- Rectangle Patterns
